A Bajillion Toy Schemes
=======================
At [StrangeLoop][] (well, really, [PWLconf][]) 2017, [James Long][] [introduced][talk] me to
Abdulaziz Ghuloum's [An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction][paper], an academic-
whitepaper-formatted compiler-writing tutorial.

At the same time, I was refreshing my ML knowledge, picking up OCaml ‚Äî and I thought it'd be fun,
perhaps, to take a stab at following the IACC, but in ML instead of Scheme.

So, someday (probably not-so-soon), this repository may contain a (shitty) (slow) (pointless)
(partial) implementation of Scheme in OCaml. ([As if there aren't][1] [enough of those already.][2]
